# ACDC - Static website generation

### Static Dynamic Website
This project is done as part of my first year of study as a student at IMT Atlantique engineering school. 
The project is developed for the [STACK research group](http://stack.inria.fr/) in order to provide them a tool that allow them to publish news on their static website easily. 

### About project
The project is adding news into the 'News' tab of the [website](http://stack.inria.fr/).
An external tool named [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is used to convert markdown into html pages and to build the html website.

The architecture is described in the following class diagram:
